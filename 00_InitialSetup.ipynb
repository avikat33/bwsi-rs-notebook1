    "This notebook will run through the initial setup of the course environment, and get you familiar with the JupyterLab interface. [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is the next-gen web interface for Jupyter, and includes additional features such as tabs, integrated file browser, and modular windows.\n",

The jupyterhub service is only available to registered participants of BWSI Remote Sensing for Disaster Relief 2020, and uses github for authentication. If you are following along on your own system, we have provided a [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/bwsiremotesensing/jupyter-gis-image/tags) which has the requirements for this course installed."

    "\n",
    "SSH keys are pairs of files---a public and a private key---which allow holders of the public key to identify if a message came from the holder of the private key. This is an example of [public-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography). We will generate a key pair and upload our public key to your GitHub account and save the private key to your jupyter server. This is an alternative to having to input your account username and password every time you make a git push/pull.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section of the lesson is adapted from the [GitHub tutorials](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) for generating a new SSH key.\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"your_email@example.com\"\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "You will then be prompted to type a passphrase to add an extra layer of security to your ssh keys. Optionally, you can leave it blank and press `Enter` to save your keys without a passphrase.\n",
